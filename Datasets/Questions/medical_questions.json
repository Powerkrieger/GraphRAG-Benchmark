        "answer": "Upon receiving this case, my first step would be to perform a comprehensive neurological exam to assess deficits and establish a baseline. The MRI findings suggest a brain mass, so I would recommend a stereotactic or open biopsy to obtain tissue for histological and molecular analysis, including IDH mutation status, which is critical for glioma classification. Based on histology and grade (e.g., low-grade vs. high-grade glioma), further management will be determined. If the tumor is resectable, maximal safe surgical resection should be pursued to reduce tumor burden and provide tissue for definitive diagnosis. Postoperatively, for high-grade gliomas (grades 3 or 4), I would coordinate adjuvant therapy with the neuro-oncology team, including radiation and chemotherapy. The patient's performance status should be evaluated to guide treatment eligibility. Periodic follow-up MRI will be scheduled to monitor for recurrence.",

        "answer": "MDT Educational Note: Cutaneous B-cell lymphomas (CBCL) are a subset of primary cutaneous lymphomas (PCL), which are non-Hodgkin lymphomas that originate in the skin. CBCLs develop from abnormal B lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell involved in immune defense. The pathogenesis involves unregulated growth of these lymphocytes, resulting in disease. CBCL typically presents as nodules or papules confined to the skin. Diagnosis requires a combination of skin examination, blood tests, imaging studies, and confirmatory biopsy with immunophenotyping to determine cell lineage. Further testing for biomarkers and genetic changes aids in precise classification. Major CBCL subtypes include primary cutaneous marginal zone lymphoma (PCMZL), primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma (PCFCL), and primary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, leg type (PC-DLBCL, leg type). Most CBCLs are slow-growing, but aggressive variants exist.",

        "answer": "Patient Information Leaflet: Understanding Cutaneous B-Cell Lymphoma (CBCL)\n\nWhat is CBCL? Cutaneous B-cell lymphoma is a rare cancer that starts in certain white blood cells (B lymphocytes) and affects the skin. It is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that remains in the skin and does not usually spread to other parts of the body.\n\nWhat are the symptoms? CBCL often appears as lumps (nodules) or small bumps (papules) on the skin. These may be painless and grow slowly.\n\nHow is it diagnosed? Your doctor will examine your skin and may order blood tests and imaging scans. The most important step is a skin biopsy, where a small piece of skin is removed and studied. Special laboratory tests (immunophenotyping) and checks for genetic changes help confirm the diagnosis and determine the exact type of lymphoma.\n\nWhy is follow-up important? Most CBCLs grow slowly, but it is important to monitor your condition regularly to catch any changes early. Your healthcare team will guide you through treatment and follow-up visits.\n\nIf you notice new skin lumps or changes, let your doctor know promptly.",

        "answer": "For a patient with newly diagnosed Stage II anal squamous cell carcinoma, the diagnostic workup should start with a digital rectal exam (DRE) and high-resolution anoscopy (HRA) to evaluate the primary lesion and surrounding tissues. A biopsy is necessary to confirm the diagnosis histologically. Imaging studies such as CT, MRI, and PET scans are recommended to assess tumor size (>2 cm as per Stage II criteria), evaluate for lymph node involvement, and rule out distant metastasis. HIV testing should be performed, as HIV infection increases the risk and may influence management. Staging is done using the AJCC TNM system. For initial management, concurrent chemoradiation is the standard of care, utilizing IMRT as the preferred radiation technique. Chemotherapy options to be given with radiation include mitomycin plus capecitabine, mitomycin plus 5-FU, or 5-FU plus cisplatin. Multidisciplinary involvement, including medical oncology, radiation oncology, colorectal surgery, and supportive care, is crucial to optimize outcomes and manage side effects.",

Core needle biopsy established the diagnosis and provided tissue for biomarker assessment, which demonstrated estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) positivity, and HER2 negativity. Sentinel lymph node biopsy identified limited nodal involvement, consistent with Stage II disease. Blood tests were unremarkable.\n\nGiven the hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative profile, the initial treatment plan includes breast-conserving surgery (lumpectomy), followed by radiation therapy. Adjuvant endocrine therapy (e.g., tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitor) is planned. Chemotherapy will be considered based on tumor grade and patient risk factors. The patient will be evaluated by fertility preservation specialists prior to systemic therapy, and performance status will be closely monitored throughout treatment.\n\nSincerely,\nDr. Smith",

        "question": "Imagine you are a medical intern tasked with writing a discharge summary for a patient with inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) who has completed neoadjuvant systemic therapy and modified radical mastectomy. Structure the summary to include diagnosis, key findings, treatment course, and follow-up recommendations.",
        "answer": "Discharge Summary:\n\nDiagnosis: Stage III inflammatory breast cancer (IBC), ER/PR negative, HER2 positive.\n\nKey Findings: Patient presented with breast swelling, redness, peau d’orange, and skin thickening. Imaging (mammogram, ultrasound, MRI) and skin biopsy confirmed IBC. Biomarker analysis revealed HER2 positivity, ER/PR negativity. Sentinel lymph node biopsy was positive for malignancy.\n\nTreatment Course: The patient received neoadjuvant systemic therapy, including chemotherapy and HER2-targeted therapy. This was followed by a modified radical mastectomy. Postoperative recovery was uneventful.\n\nFollow-up Recommendations: Initiate adjuvant radiation therapy and continue HER2-targeted agents as indicated. Schedule regular physical exams and imaging for surveillance. Monitor for recurrence and treatment-related toxicities. Multidisciplinary follow-up is recommended.\n\nSigned,\nMedical Intern",

        "question": "You are a patient advocate tasked with drafting a public health notice to educate the community about breast cancer risk factors, screening, and the importance of early detection. Your notice should reference clinical evidence and recommended practices.",
        "answer": "Public Health Notice: Protect Yourself—Know the Facts About Breast Cancer\n\nBreast cancer is a carcinoma that starts in the cells of the breast and affects individuals assigned female at birth, particularly those with a family history or BRCA1/2 mutations. Regular screening mammograms are crucial for early detection, even in people without symptoms. If you experience breast lumps, pain, nipple discharge, or skin changes such as redness or swelling, consult your healthcare provider promptly. Early-stage breast cancer is more treatable and has better outcomes. We encourage all eligible individuals to undergo recommended screenings and discuss personal risk factors with their doctor.\n\nIssued by: Community Health Board",

        "answer": "SOAP Progress Note\n\nSubjective: Patient reports persistent bone pain and intermittent shortness of breath. No new neurological symptoms or liver dysfunction.\n\nObjective: Imaging tests (PET scan) confirm metastases to bone and lung. Blood tests within normal limits. Biopsy confirms metastatic breast cancer. Biomarker analysis reveals hormone receptor positivity (ER/PR+) and HER2 negativity. Performance status remains stable.\n\nAssessment: Stage IV metastatic breast cancer with bone and pulmonary involvement, hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative.\n\nPlan: Continue systemic therapy with endocrine therapy and CDK4/6 inhibitor. Monitor for disease progression with regular imaging and physical exams. Manage bone metastases with bisphosphonates. Provide supportive care for symptom control. Discuss ongoing eligibility for targeted therapies.\n",

        "question": "Assume the role of a genetic counselor. Prepare a summary for a patient newly found to have a BRCA1 mutation, explaining the implications for breast cancer risk, recommended surveillance, and potential preventive strategies.",
        "answer": "Genetic Counseling Summary:\n\nYou have tested positive for a BRCA1 mutation, which significantly increases your risk of developing breast cancer. Having a BRCA1 mutation is a strong risk factor and may also impact your family members’ risk. We recommend enhanced surveillance, including annual mammograms and breast MRI starting at an earlier age. Preventive strategies may include risk-reducing medications or prophylactic surgery (such as bilateral mastectomy or oophorectomy). It is important to discuss these options with your oncology and surgical teams. Family members may also wish to consider genetic testing. Ongoing follow-up and support resources are available to you.\n",
