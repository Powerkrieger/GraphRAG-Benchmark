        "answer": "Ladies and gentlemen, welcome. Today, I invite you to trace the journey of music across civilizations. Here, we see the lyre played by David, who famously suspended the kinnor—an instrument later rendered as the harp. Our Anglo-Saxon manuscripts, now preserved in this very British Museum, show the harp’s lasting influence. Nearby, we exhibit cymbals once used by Egyptians, whose dulcimers—known as santir—echo the Persian tradition. Such instruments not only delight musicians but also deserve the close attention of ethnologists, for they tell the story of cultural exchange.",
